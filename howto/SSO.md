# SSO with OIDC

`jotty·page` supports any OIDC provider (Authentik, Auth0, Keycloak, Okta, etc.) with these requirements:

- Supports PKCE (most modern providers do)
- Can be configured as a public client (no client secret needed)
- Provides standard OIDC scopes (openid, profile, email)

1. Configure your OIDC Provider:

- Client Type: Public
- Grant Type: Authorization Code with PKCE
- Scopes: openid, profile, email
- Redirect URI: https://YOUR_APP_HOST/api/oidc/callback
- Post-logout URI: https://YOUR_APP_HOST/

2. Get these values from your provider:

- Client ID
- OIDC Issuer URL (usually ends with .well-known/openid-configuration)

3. Set environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  jotty:
    environment:
      - SSO_MODE=oidc
      - OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_SSO_HOST/issuer/path
      - OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
      - APP_URL=https://your-jotty-domain.com # if not set defaults to http://localhost:<port>
      # Optional security enhancements:
      - OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret # Enable confidential client mode (if your provider requires it)
      - SSO_FALLBACK_LOCAL=true # Allow both SSO and local login
      - OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS=admins # Map provider groups to admin role

Note: When OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET is set, jotty·page switches to confidential client mode using client authentication instead of PKCE. This is more secure but requires provider support.
```

Dev verified Providers:

- Auth0 (`OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_TENANT.REGION.auth0.com`)
- Authentik (`OIDC_ISSUER=https://YOUR_DOMAIN/application/o/APP_SLUG/`)

Other providers will likely work, but I can at least guarantee these do as I have test them both locally.

p.s. **First user to sign in via SSO when no local users exist becomes admin automatically.**
